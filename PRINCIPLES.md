# Design and Development Principles

These principles guide the design and development of this project:

*   **Component-Based Architecture:** Designs should use a component-based approach for easier maintenance and feature updates.
*   **Astro over React:** Prefer Astro components for static content and page structure. Use React only for interactive elements.
*   **Content Separation:** Separate content (text, data) from logic by storing it in `.ts` files or a CMS.
*   **Data Structures:** Maintain JSON structures when adding, editing, or deleting data.
*   **Future-Proofing:** Consider future integration with Supabase for storage, database, and authentication.
*   **File and Folder Structure:** Use a clear and maintainable file and folder structure.
*   **Code Comments:** Use comments to explain features and functionality.
*   **SEO:** Ensure pages have appropriate titles and descriptions for search engine optimization.
*   **Avoid Duplication:** When adding new features, check for existing files that can be updated to avoid duplication.
*   **Dark Mode:** Aim to implement a dark mode for the application.
*   **Global Styles:** Use intuitive and consistent patterns for global styles.
*   **Form UI/UX:** Ensure forms have good UI/UX with appropriate padding for form fields.
